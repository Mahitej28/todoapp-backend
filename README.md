# ✍️ToDo Application

This project created using the <b>MERN </b>(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) stack is a web-based application that helps users manage their daily tasks and stay organized. The app allows users to create, update, and delete tasks.

📌The app's frontend is built using <b>React.js</b>, which provides a modern and dynamic user interface. The app provides a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to add new tasks, mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks that are no longer relevant.

📌The app's backend is built using<b> Node.js</b> and <b>Express.js</b>, providing a RESTful API for data storage and retrieval. <b>MongoDB </b>is used as the database for storing task-related data, such as task descriptions, due dates, and completion status.

👉🏾Frontend Repo [here]()


## ⚙️ Steps for Backend
1. Use the <b>git clone</b> command followed by the repository URL to clone the repository to your local machine. 
2. Once the code is cloned, navigate to the project's directory by typing cd repository-name in the terminal.
3. Install the dependencies required to run the frontend of the app by running the command <b>npm install</b>.
4. Next, create a <b>.env</b> file in the root directory of the project and add the necessary environment variables like PORT, MONGO_URI, etc. 
<br><i>Please refer to the project's documentation to know which variables are needed.</i>
5. Start the backend server by running the command <b>npm start</b>.
6. If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message in the terminal indicating that the server is listening on a specific port (usually 5000).
<br><i>You can now interact with the app's backend API by sending HTTP requests to the API endpoints. The documentation for these endpoints should be available in the project's documentation or API documentation.</i>
